# Environmental Sampling
 
The Hutchinsonâ€™s duality allows linking a point in geography to a point in an n-dimensional environmental space where ecological niches are defined. We took advantage of this relationship to design future surveys of a species of interest based on the suitibility values from an Ecological Niche Model (ENM) or Species Distribution Model (SDM). Sampling in different environmental gradients has the advantage of obtaining information that was excluded for the model calibration phase due to the lack of occurrence points. 

Potential detections of the species of interest from different suitability categories, especially those that are different from the maximum value of suitability will improve the fitting of ecological niche models by adding occurrences.

The example included here focuses on the region Ceara, in Brazil and the species Burkholderia pseudomallei (the Gram-negative bacteria known to cause the infectious disease called Melioidosis). However, the methodology of environmental sampling presented can be replicated for other states, countries, or regions.
